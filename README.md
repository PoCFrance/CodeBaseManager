# CodeBaseManager

## Description
CodeBaseManager is a command line tool designed to ease the development of projects through multiple, single purpose, language independant, modules.

It will have a backend inspired by **[Unison project](https://www.unisonweb.org/)** to hold informations about the codebase, build system and such, of the project for the modules to use.

## Modules
A module fills up a specific task. In the future they will be able to interact with the backend and with each other (for specific features).

### Current

- [CodeBase](): Allows to easily find informations about the codebase.
 
- [Functional Tests](): Allows to easily test a binary through the use of [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) files to describe tests.

### Predicted

- Unit Tests: Allows to easily write unit tests for your functions.
- Build: Allows to describe a build system in a unique way.
- Debug: Allows to easily debug your program or functions.
